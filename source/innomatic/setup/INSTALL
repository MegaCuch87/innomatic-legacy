INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE QUESTIONS
----------------------------------

Q. When I click on the "Next" button at the bottom of the page during "System
check" phase, nothing happens.

A. Check that the Innomatic directories have the right users and permissions.
Typical user/group for Apache is nobody:nogroup or apache:apache. The same
applies for Windows, you must ensure that the directories are writable by the
web server user.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Innomatic hangs after the installation or upgrade of a application.

A. The installation/upgrade process has been interrupted and the lock file
core/temp/upgrading_system has not been removed. Remove it accessing
[Innomatic Web URL]/root/unlock from your browser.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. I'm unable to complete the database creation phase during setup.

A. This is likely to be a database permissions problem. You may try making
sure that the specified database user has access to the database not only from
localhost, but also by the IP address and domain name. Then change the default
localhost on the form to your domain. If this doesn'work, you may also try
with 127.0.0.1 as IP address, for certains setup this works.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. POST forms with attribute enctype="multipart/form-data" don't pass
parameters.

A. PHP must have file_uploads set to On in php.ini
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Q. Since Innomatic archive size is greater than 2 megabytes I'm unable to
update it in the applications administration page.

A. The standard PHP upload file size limit is set to 2M. Increase it to a value
bigger than the Innomatic archive, e.g.: upload_max_filesize = 8M
