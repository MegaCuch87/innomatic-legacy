3000 3.2.1 - 2003/01/31
-----------------------
NEW FEATURES:
- Added the ability to removeChild() and removeAllChildren() for Element objects
  (minixml.library).
- Added the ability to prependChild() and insertChild(CHILD, INDEX)
  (minixml.library).
- Add support for system.multicall() to both the client and the server
  (xmlrpc.library).
- Added new error messages for system.multicall() (xmlrpc.library).
- Added new procedure call system.multicall() (xmlrpc.library). See
  http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$1208 for details.
- xmlrpc_client::send (xmlrpc.library) can now take an array of xmlrpcmsg's as
  an argument. In that case it will attempt to execute the whole array of
  procure calls in a single HTTP request using system.multicall(). (If that
  attempt fails, then the calls will be excuted one at a time). The return
  value will be an array of xmlrpcresp's (or 0 upon transport failure).
- Added setSSLVerifyPeer and setSSLVerifyHost (xmlrpc.library); as of curl 7.10,
  various certificate checks are done (by default). The default for
  CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYHOST is to ensure the common name on the cert matches the
  provided hostname.  This breaks a lot of stuff, so allow users to override it.
- Added message of the day feature in sites.

CHANGES:
- Updated minixml.library to MiniXML 1.2.4 release.
- Updated xmlrpc.library to XmlRpc 1.0.99.2.

  standard mysql_query() statements.
- Renamed $_xh[$parser]['ha'] to $_xh[$parser]['headers'] (xmlrpc.library).
- xmlrpcresp and parseResponse cleanups (xmlrpc.library); some variable names
  renamed ('xv' to 'val', for example), added type checking, and stricter
  default values.
- Changed $gEnv['runtime']['disp'] initialization due to array_merge()
  behaviour change in PHP 4.3.0.

FIXES:
- Fixes to getElement (inability to fetch nested tags of same name)
  (minixml.library).
- Fixed bugs related to $_xh[$parser]['headers] (xmlrpc.library); some places
  treated this as an array, others as a scalar. Now treated unconditionally as
  an array. Also wrapped header debugging output in PRE tags.
- Fixed xmlrpcresp's faultcode (xmlrpc.library); return -1 for FAULT responses
  from the server whose faultcodes don't reflect any errors.
- Fixed wrong cast to integer in various caching methods (cache.library).
  This bug caused the creation of new Hui theme cache files for each page
  request, resulting in thousands of wrong cache files.
- Fixed bug in extraction of archived files (archives.library) in systems which
  differentiate between binary and text files during fopen(). This caused
  corruption of binary files in module archives when installing/upgrading them,
  so that when updating Ampoliros the images got corrupted.
