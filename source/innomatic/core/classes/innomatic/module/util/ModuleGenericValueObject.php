 * Generic value object whose members are defined at runtime.

 * There are occasions where a Module value object structure is not hard coded
 * in a dedicated value object class. This is a common occurrence when Module
 * value object fields are declared in its module.xml configuration file.
 *
 * In such cases, using the EmptyValueObject would be incoherent, so this
 * generic value object class has been implementated.
