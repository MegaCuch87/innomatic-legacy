General information
-------------------

Innomatic is an open source platform for building multi-tenant cloud
applications developed by Innoteam Srl in PHP language.

It is suitable as an Internet/Intranet development and deployment
system, featuring a powerful modular architecture and allowing very fast
deployment and distribution of web based solutions.

Innomatic is not a framework like Symfony or similar.

It is a platform aimed at building, deploying, distributing and managing
multi-tenant applications and quickly enabling them to multiple customers
hosted in a single Innomatic installation.

It also contains a number of mini frameworks, like an MVC system to be used
when building back office oriented applications. Over Innomatic you can also
stack up other layered frameworks (e.g. a Content Management Framework and an
e-Commerce platform using the CMF) and user-centric applications.



Features
--------

- Web interface. The first standard Innomatic interface is the web desktop.

- Web services interface. The container provides a powerful interface for
XmlRpc web services calls.

- Centralized tenants administration. Creation, editing and remotion
of the tenants can be done through a single interface.

- Centralized applications administration. Installation, update and
remotion of the applications is done through a single interface.

- Extensibility of container functions. Container functions can be extended
through external applications and hooks.

- Extreme modularity. The whole container is designed with modularity in
mind.

- Interaction between the applications. Every application can interact
with the other applications, through API calls, hooks, web services and other.
The container also provides dependencies support between
applications.

- Immediate installation and update of applications. To install an
application in the container you only need to upload the application
file through a applications administration page. The same applies for the
update of already installed applications.

- Install applications once - use many times. When installing an
application, it can be enabled to all container sites without
manually reinstalling it.

- Easy installation and immediate update of the container. Since Innomatic
is seen by itself as a deployable application, it has all of applications
properties and can be updated like any other application with a single step.

- Separation of code and presentation. Application interface is
programmed with a dedicated library of functions; no HTML in code.

- Override system. Applications can be customized without affecting other
tenants and without changing the original application code with the override
feature.

- Use of open standards and technologies. Innomatic follows open standards
like SQL, YAML, XML, XML-RPC and so on.

- Open source license. Innomatic is licensed with the new BSD License.

- Localization support. Innomatic supports country and language
localization, both at container and applications level.

- Context sensitive help. The system provides online help.

- Database abstraction. The container provides an extensible database
abstraction layer. Current available interfaces: PostgreSQL and MySQL.

- Written in PHP language. Innomatic is written in PHP 5, a language born
and specifically designed for the web.

- Cross platform. Being written in PHP language, Innomatic can be
installed in every operating system where PHP has been ported.
